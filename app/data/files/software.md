# AI Integrations & Software

## **Molecular Modeling & Gene Design**
- **PyMOL & AlphaFold:**  
  - Used for structural analysis since no pre-existing protein structure was available.
  - Allowed visualization and prediction of the 3D conformation of human pPOP2.

- **SnapGene:**  
  - Converted amino acid sequences from NCBI into nucleotide sequences.
  - Designed and built the gene fragment for expression.
  - Simulated cloning steps to ensure correct restriction site placement.

## **AI & Workflow Automation**
- **N8n - AI Workflow Automation:**  
  - Used as a testbed for integrating AI-driven project management and workflow optimization.
  - Developed several AI-powered agents to assist with team operations:
    - **Calendar Agent:**  
      - Managed scheduling using natural language processing.
      - Helped coordinate events, responsibilities, and communication among 12 team members.
    - **Weekly Newsletter Agent (Unfinished):**  
      - Designed to compile weekly notes and summarize project progress.
      - Pulled from team documents and communications.
      - Did not get fully implemented due to project workload shifts.
    - **Vectorized Database Agent:**  
      - Stored all project-related information as vector embeddings in Supabase.
      - Enabled conversational querying of project knowledge.

- **Website & Front-End Development:**
  - Used **Bolt.new** to create the website for showcasing the project.
  - Explored additional tools like **Lovable** and **Cursor** for potential integration.
  - Actively incorporating these into project workflows as development continues.

## **Future AI & Automation Expansions**
- Continue integrating AI-driven tools to streamline research workflows.
- Expand the use of automation for documentation and knowledge retention.
- Optimize front-end and back-end development using no-code and low-code solutions.
