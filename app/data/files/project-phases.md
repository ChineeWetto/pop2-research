# Project Phases

## **Phase 1: Team Formation & Ideation**
- **Icebreakers & Team Building:**
  - Engaged in exercises to get to know each other, understand values, and establish trust.
  - Discussed individual strengths, backgrounds, and interests to determine contributions to the project.
  - Explored how each team member’s expertise could shape the research direction.
  
- **Brainstorming & Research Question Development:**
  - Considered various topics, including stem cells, brain tumors, Alzheimer's, microplastics, water quality, and cannabis effects.
  - Aiming for a bio-based project, we focused on issues that incorporated both lab and data work.
  - Narrowed ideas based on feasibility, scientific merit, and potential impact.
  - Adopted an "always questioning" mindset:
    - *What do we need to know?*
    - *Why is it important?*
    - *What kind of data will answer our questions?*
    - *Where can we find it?*
    - *Whom do we contact for access?*
    - *What’s the timeline for acquisition?*

## **Phase 2: Project Proposal & Funding**
- **Proposal Preparation:**
  - Developed a formal project plan, defining objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes.
  - Identified major challenges and structured the research timeline.
  - Ensured the proposal met institutional requirements and funding criteria.

- **Funding Acquisition:**
  - Submitted a funding proposal to our anonymous investor.
  - Upon approval, received financial support to purchase the plasmid and other essential materials.

## **Phase 3: Research Preparation & Literature Review**
- **Manuscript & Protocol Review:**
  - Studied scientific literature to refine our approach.
  - Investigated prior research on neuroinflammation, yeast expression systems, and protein purification.

- **Lab Readiness & Safety Training:**
  - Established a comprehensive lab plan and reviewed lab safety protocols.
  - Secured laboratory access and obtained necessary reagents and equipment.
  - Prepared lab notebooks, organized documentation, and finalized experimental workflows.

## **Phase 4: Experimental Work**
- **Plasmid Design & Preparation:**
  - Designed and ordered the plasmid for E. coli transformation.
  - Conducted transformation procedures and verified plasmid integrity.

- **Yeast Expression Trials:**
  - Attempted subcloning into a yeast vector (pRS423-GAL).
  - Encountered issues with restriction sites and had to reassess the cloning strategy.
  - Pivoted to a new approach using Gibson Assembly to correct enzyme selection errors.

- **Ongoing Lab Work:**
  - Actively conducting transformation experiments and expression analysis.
  - Troubleshooting unexpected challenges in cloning and protein expression.

## **Phase 5: Data Analysis**
- **Experimental Validation:**
  - Analyze transformation efficiency and protein expression results.
  - Evaluate enzyme digestion, gel electrophoresis, and sequencing data.

- **Interpreting Findings:**
  - Assess results to determine whether our approach successfully expressed the protein.
  - Compare data from different expression systems (E. coli vs. yeast, if yeast experiments are recovered).

## **Phase 6: Final Presentation & Dissemination**
- **MURALS & CURC Presentations:**
  - Prepare poster and oral presentations for research symposiums.
  - Structure findings into a clear, impactful research narrative.
  - Address challenges and future implications of our research.

- **Final Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:**
  - Summarize findings and experimental protocols for future research teams.
  - Reflect on project challenges, pivots, and lessons learned.
  - Publish materials for internal and external audiences to ensure knowledge transfer.
