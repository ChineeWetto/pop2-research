# Overview

- **Group Overview**
  - 10 students from different STEM fields.
  - Group name: United in STEM, CSU (Colorado State University).
  - Members come from biology, fermentation science, computer science, data science, math, and economics.
  - Diverse backgrounds and ethnicities (e.g., Trinidad and Tobago, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and U.S.-born).

- **Team Formation & Building**
  - Started with team-building icebreakers.
  - Focused on getting comfortable with each other.
  - Practiced sharing feedback and constructive criticism.
  - Explored each member’s skills and personal interests.

- **Idea Generation & Brainstorming**
  - Held multiple sessions to throw out research ideas.
  - Proposed topics included stem cells, brain tumors, Alzheimer’s, cancer, microplastics, water quality, cannabis effects, environmental stresses, and more.
  - Discussed pros and cons of lab-based versus data-based projects.
  - Emphasized a bio-based project with some lab work to interest everyone.
  - **Always Questioning:** As a group, we consistently asked:
    - "What do I need to know?"
    - "Why do I need to know it?"
    - "What kind of data will answer the questions?"
    - "Where can I find the data?"
    - "Whom do I contact for access?"
    - "What's the timeline for acquisition?"
  - This questioning mindset helped us deeply understand our objectives and guided our decision-making process.

- **Decision Process**
  - Used weekly polls to rank research ideas.
  - Combined similar ideas to narrow down choices.
  - Settled on a yeast-based research project as it was cost-effective and covered many bases.
  - Chose to focus on yeast-based therapeutic proteins for neuroinflammation, with a view toward Alzheimer’s research.

- **Research Focus & Development**
  - Decided on yeast because it allowed a mix of lab work and data analysis.
  - Drew inspiration from CSU research on nanoligamers.
  - Reached out via email to CSU researchers for more information.
  - Kept UN’s Sustainable Development Goals in mind for practical impact.

- **Team Skills & Learning**
  - Developed project management and time management skills.
  - Learned how to work as a team and handle different viewpoints.
  - Balanced individual research interests with the group’s common goal.
  - Navigated resource and funding challenges using CSU systems.

- **Mentorship & Support**
  - Guided by group facilitators Casper and Mo.
  - Casper provided more hands-on support.
  - Facilitators helped with resource navigation and project direction.

- **Project Timeline**
  - A year-long project spanning two semesters.
  - Evolved from brainstorming to focused research.
  - The process involved continuous idea refinement and team collaboration.
